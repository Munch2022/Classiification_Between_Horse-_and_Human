# Classification_Between_Horse-_and_Human
This repo contains code that classify the images of horses and humans using DL; Convolutional Neural Network

# Performing Binary Classification on Horses and Humans: Project Overview
* Created a tool that can predict and classify if the given image is horse or a human
* Dataset is obtained from Tensorflow
* Implemented CNN model for this classfication problem 
* Trained the model very well that it's even able to classify the new images of horses and humans
